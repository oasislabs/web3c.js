      <h2>Interaction with confidential contracts</h2>
      <p>
      A confidential contract can be interacted with through an interface very
      similar to the one already exposed through Web3. Instead of the
      <code>web3.eth.contract</code> API, one uses
      <code>web3.confidential.contract</code>. Confidential contracts are
      instantiated in the same way as a standard contract - by providing the
      ABI defining the methods and properties which can be called. An
      instance of a contract is made in a slightly different way, and this is
      the only way in which the API diverges from non-confidential contracts.
      Instead of calling <code>at(deployed_address)</code>, to instantiate an
      interface to a contract deployed at an address on the chain, one intead
      calls <code>at(deployed_address, public_key)</code>. The additional
      parameter specifies the long-term public key of the confidential contract,
      providing a root of trust allowing the client to securely negotiate a
      confidential channel for requests to the remote contract.

        <h2>Creating Confidential Contracts</h2>
        <p>
          A new confidential contract is deployed in much the same way as a
          normal contract deployment: A transaction containing the contract
          code is sent with no <i>to</i> destination specified. Confidential
          contracts are distinguished from normal contracts by a prefix in the
          data parameter of the transaction. This is the same mechanism that
          would distinguish a wasm contract from an EVM contract. In the case
          of confidential contracts, the prefix is <code>\0pri</code> The
          initial 0 byte, as in wasm contracts, is a stop instruction to the
          evm interpreter for backwards compatibility.

      <h1>Under the hood</h1>
      <section>
        <h2>Establishing a secure channel</h2>
        <p>
        In the standard mental model of interaction with a smart contract, the
        contract is identified by the address it is deployed on chain. A client
        can validate that it is interacting with the expected contract by
        checking what's deployed at that location, and making sure the code of
        the contract meets expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
        In confidential contracts, an additional step is needed - the client
        must determine the public key with which to encrypt messages to the
        contract. This key is dynamic - it may change over time - meaning that
        a request for the current public key, and associated validation, is
        nessicary at the beginning of each session.
        </p>
        <p>
        The current encryption key for a confidential contract can be
        retrieved by calling <code>confidential_getPublicKey</code> for the contract
        address.
        </p>

        <h2>An encrypted call</h2>
        <p>
        To make a confidential call, the public key above is used to encrypt the
        data field of a standard call. This field contains a reference to which
        method of the contract should be called, along with the arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
        The low-level <code>confidential_call_enc</code> and
        <code>confidential_sendRawTransaction_enc</code> should be
        provided with this encrypted state. It is up to the client to have
        encrypted the call, and gotten a local wallet to sign the resulting
        serialized data.
